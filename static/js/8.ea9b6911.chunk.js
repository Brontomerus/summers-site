My passions include petting dogs, adopting dogs, walking dogs, and generally being near dogs. I'm also an avid popsicle eater and enjoy a nice cocktail to unwind after a long week.\n\n# About Me\nI grew up in the small town of [Congress, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress,_Ohio). I am also formerly Amish, having chose to abandon my kin following my epic Rumspringa in which I consumed enough alcohol to kill the family horse and proceeded to be detained by the local policeforce for reasons I will not detail on this webpage. My boyfriend is a genious though, so you should go give him money or something.\n\n\n# I like\n\n- Loki\n- Dogs\n- Foxes\n- TV shows\n- Enduro races\n- My mom, Kimmy\n- Summer (the season, but I guess myself as well)\n- Brandon, my boyfriend\n- Getting paint on everything I own\n- Crafts\n\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I'm generally considered a very crafty person.\n- I have finished in the top 10 of an Enduro Race at Hilltop Speedway.\n- If I could own all the dogs in the world, I would without a doubt.\n\n\n# I dream of\n\n- dogs.\n- A great career.\n\n",c=l.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(i.b,Object(s.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(d.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Summer Nairn",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(r.a,{source:l,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
