# Intro

I am an undergrad student at [Kent State University](https://www.kent.edu/caed), studying Architecture. My passions include petting dogs, adopting dogs, walking dogs, and generally being near dogs. I'm also an avid popsicle eater and enjoy a nice cocktail to unwind after a long week.

# About Me
I grew up in the small town of [Congress, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress,_Ohio). I am also formerly Amish, having chose to abandon my kin following my epic Rumspringa in which I consumed enough alcohol to kill the family horse and proceeded to be detained by the local policeforce for reasons I will not detail on this webpage. My boyfriend is a genious though, so you should go give him money or something.
